# Light Activated Window Blinds

I made this Iot project for a microcontroller class in my 4th year at ubc. I successfully programmed a MSP 430 to open and close a blinds prototype when exposed to light using a light sensor system.
The light sensor system was built using a photo diode and resistor.

Materials used:
- MSP 430 Microcontroller
- DC Motor
- H-drive
- Photo diode
- $10 KOhm resistor
- Wires
- Cardboard, hot glue and wire
- 5V Relay
